  Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare is half prequel, half reboot to the Modern Warfare franchise. The game takes place before the events of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,
   but since this is a re-imagining of the entire story, developer
   Infinity Ward still has plenty of room to not simply revisit the events of those earlier games, but alter and expand upon them however they see fit.
  </p>

  <p class = "content">
    It’s also a return to a more grounded, realistic military shooter after years of futuristic entries (Call Of Duty: WWII notwithstanding). 
    Gone are advanced mobility mechanics–double-jumping and wall-running–and good riddance. You’re still able to slide into a crouch,
     and Infinity Ward has added door-mechanics that allow you to either open doors slowly or burst through, making your entrances that much more dramatic.
  </p>

  <p class = "content">
    Likewise, the hero-shooter aspects of Black Ops 3 and 4 are no more–and good riddance to that, as well. 
    You have different operators to play as in multiplayer, but there are no special powers cluttering up matches. 
    In Special Ops Operators do have passive and active abilities, but that’s co-op and it’s still toned down from what we saw in last year’s game.
  </p>
  <p class = "content">
    I’m a sucker for a good Call Of Duty campaign, and I’ll be very upfront about this: I like almost all of them. Some are better than others, 
    but they’re always entertaining. Besides, you can fine-tune the difficulty to exactly the level of challenge you want.
</p>
<p class = "content">
  I played Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare’s campaign on “Hardened” which means I died regularly but never got stuck. I’m going to play it again on “Veteran” to really 
  amp up the challenge, but “Hardened” is a pretty good balance between challenge and fun. “Your skills will be strained” about sums it up.
