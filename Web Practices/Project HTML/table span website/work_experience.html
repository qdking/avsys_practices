<p>R&D Scientist</p>
At this startup company, we focused on developing a novel medical device technology for kidney-failure patients. This involves recycling the dialysate through a column of chemical sorbent to adsorb most toxins, thereby revolutionizing hemodialysis for minimizing the usage of 30 litres of costly sterile fluid to simply 4 litres per treatment.
<br>
Here were my key highlights:
<br>
<ul>

    <li>Prototyped small-scale experimental laboratory setups to resemble a prospective full-scale dialysis machine, for cost-effective/faster testing.</li>
    <li>Optimized sorbents systemically via quantitative analysis and pattern recognition; achieving the pioneering method to minimize net change of vital electrolytes throughout the entire duration.</li>
    <li>Hastened data entry/processing from a ~1 hour to a 10-minute duration via self-learning on macros recording and editing VBA scripts for different experiment templates.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Simulated 18 scenarios of different possible patient initial electrolyte/toxin levels in 3 weeks timeframe; results achieved approval from the Dutch Kidney Foundation's Medical Advisory Board.</li>
    <li>Transitioned laboratory miniature experiments into full-sized hemodialysis clinical trials on adult pigs, with particular attention to sterile handling and on-site emergency troubleshooting. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Developed synthesis variations to improve the properties of 2 fundamental zirconium materials used (e.g. capacity increased from 0.30 to 0.85 out of 1.10); offered a 1-day alternative to a 2-days procedure.</li>
    <li>Supervised and mentored 2 interns in their projects such that they became more independent in problem-solving when any methods used needed to be modified.</li>
</ul>
