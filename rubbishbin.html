                Hi, thanks for visiting my profile portfoliohaving to see my unglam photos.
                <br>
                The name's Shang Ce, you can call me by my alphabetical initials SC or CSC.
                <br><br>
                I'm an aspiring Software Developer/Engineer, am still a beginner to pick up the ropes, wishing to try out developing some whacky funky 
                apps and software on my own during my free time. Am also very into good stories and writing, so game writing may be a thing I would want to explore in the far future.
